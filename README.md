# Mathematical Methods for Physics — University of Córdoba (UCO)

This repository serves as a centralized **compendium of pedagogical resources** and theoretical notes covering the diverse modules of **Mathematical Methods** within the Bachelor’s Degree in Physics at the **University of Córdoba (UCO)**.

The primary objective of these materials is to establish a robust **analytical toolkit** essential for the formal development and rigorous articulation of physical theories. The content bridges the gap between abstract mathematical structures and their direct application in theoretical and experimental physics.

## Core Curricular Pillars

The repository is structured around four fundamental branches of mathematical analysis:

### 1. Statistical Methods
* **Scope:** Foundations of probability theory, stochastic processes, and advanced data analysis.
* **Applications:** Error analysis, statistical mechanics, and quantum uncertainty quantification.

### 2. Complex Analysis
* **Scope:** Theory of complex variables, including Cauchy’s integral theorems, Laurent series, and residue calculus.
* **Applications:** Contour integration in physics, conformal mapping, and stability analysis in linear systems.

### 3. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
* **Scope:** Systematic study of linear and non-linear ODEs, existence-uniqueness theorems, power series solutions, and autonomous systems.
* **Applications:** Classical mechanics, population dynamics, and circuit theory.

### 4. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
* **Scope:** Mathematical treatment of boundary value problems (BVP) and initial value problems (IVP). Covers the heat equation, wave equation, and Laplace/Schrödinger equations.
* **Methods:** Separation of variables, Fourier and Laplace transforms, and Green’s functions.
